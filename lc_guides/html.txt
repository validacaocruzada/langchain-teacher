Lesson 1: Introduction to HTML and Creating Your First Web Page
--------------------------------------------------------------

## Content

### What is HTML?

HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of web content and structure. It is not a programming language but a markup language meant to structure web page content. HTML consists of a series of elements that you can use to contain different parts of your web page content.

### Structure of an HTML document

An HTML document contains structured content wrapped within HTML tags. The basic structure typically includes doctype declaration, html, head, and body tags.

### Basic HTML Tags

Common HTML tags include headings (`h1` to `h6`), paragraphs (`p`), anchors (`a`), images (`img`), unordered lists (`ul`), ordered lists (`ol`), list items (`li`), line breaks (`br`), and horizontal lines (`hr`).

### Special Characters and Entities

HTML uses entities to represent special characters, like `&amp;` for an ampersand (`&`), `&lt;` for a less-than sign (`<`), or `&gt;` for a greater-than sign (`>`).

## Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph about me.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Gaming</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <p>Contact me at <a href="mailto:email@example.com">email@example.com</a></p>
    <img src="path-to-image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
</body>
</html>
```
